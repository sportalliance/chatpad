**Use in browser at [chatpad.sportalliance.com](https://chatpad.sportalliance.com/)**

Everything (API Keys, settings and chats) is stored *locally in your browser*, thus **Sport Alliance does not and cannot monitor any communications/chats with OpenAI**.

Sport Alliance does however monitor general API usage and costs, which do not leak any content.
