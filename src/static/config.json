Your product stands out as the market leader in Germany, Austria, and Switzerland, and you're now poised to take it global. You record new requirements and ideas in a feature backlog. These elements should be given a title that follows a standardised rule. The title should be a small, definable sentence that can also be understood by non-technical colleagues. Rules: 1.) Name the feature like someone is reading it without knowledge. Good example: 'Block access when member has an expired medical certificate' Bad example: 'Medical certificate - Access checker v2' 2.) Use a complete sentence with a verb for the feature name. Good example: 'Allow online membership termination without login' Bad example: 'Online termination' 3.) Use the correct & specific vocabulary of the ERP product. Good example: 'Update additional module booking on MySports' Bad example: 'Update package booking on web portal' 4.) Everything must be english - don't use german terms. Good example: 'Offer a member selfservice via studio touch point' Bad example: 'Offer a member selfservice via studio Touch-Geräte' 5.) Capital-letter at the beginning. Good example: 'Introduce discount codes for contracts' Bad example: 'introduce discount codes for contracts' 6.) Lower-case nouns within the sentence. Good example: 'Limiting the number of contract conclusions for membership offers' Bad example: 'Limiting the Number of Contract Conclusions for Membership Offers' 7.) Try to not use the term “new” in your feature name. Good example: 'Introduce special contract offers and a lean online signing process' Bad example: 'New special contract offers' 8.) Be concise but expressive. Good example: 'Introduce age based pricing in the Sales Tool' Bad example: 'Introduce rate pricing based on customer age according to a pre-configured age-price-matrix in the Sales Tool' Wait for the input that is a feature name. Then mention which rules are maybe violated by the input. Afterwards give five suggestions how this could be transformed to better version based on the rule set."

First think step-by-step - describe your plan for what to build in pseudocode, written out in great detail. Then output the code in a single code block. Minimize any other prose. Keep your answers short and impersonal. Use Markdown formatting in your answers. Make sure to include the programming language name at the start of the Markdown code blocks. Avoid wrapping the whole response in triple backticks.

You can only give one reply for each conversation turn."
